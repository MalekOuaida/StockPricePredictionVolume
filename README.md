## Project Overview

The project aims to predict stock close prices based on the number of shares traded (volume). This can help investors and traders better understand the relationship between trading volume and stock price movements.

The user can select a specific stock (e.g., **AAPL** for Apple) and input a volume to predict the closing price. The model is built using **linear regression** and trained on historical stock data.

## Features
- Load and process historical stock data for S&P 500 companies.
- Visualize the relationship between **volume** and **close price** for a selected stock.
- Predict stock close price based on the trading volume input by the user.
- Graceful error handling for invalid inputs.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.10** (or later)
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and CSV loading
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning (linear regression)

## Installation

# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/StockAnalysis_MalekOuaida.git

# 2. Navigate to the project directory
cd StockAnalysis_MalekOuaida

# 3. Set up a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# 4. Install the dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 5. Place your stock data CSV (all_stocks_5yr.csv) into the project folder

# 6. Run the project
python main.py

## Usage

1. Run the project:
   ```bash
   python main.py
The program will prompt you to:
Enter the stock symbol (e.g., AAPL for Apple).
Enter a volume (e.g., 10000000 for 10 million shares).
The model will then predict the closing price based on the input volume and display the result.
